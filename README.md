# bootstrap-responsive-portfolio

On this project, we worked on implimenting all of our skills thus far - inital HTML page, additional CSS, all with Bootstrap.  It gives me hope to use Bootstrap, but there is still much to learn.  I would still love to have a better understanding of containers and how to move pictures in and around.
